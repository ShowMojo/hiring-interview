### Please describe found weak places below.

#### Security issues

1. Authentication and authorization are missing, allowing anyone to view personal data on index and show pages. Access control should be implemented to restrict access to sensitive information based on user roles and permissions.
2. The `transactions#create` action should use strong parameters to whitelist and validate the input parameters to prevent unauthorized data manipulation.
3. Identified vulnerabilities in the `nokogiri` and `puma` gems using `bundle-audit`. Updated these gems to address the security vulnerabilities.
4. Added the `brakeman` gem to analyze and identify potential security vulnerabilities in the dynamic template rendering of `transactions#new` and `transactions#create`. Need to pay attention on them.

#### Performance issues

1. Including the manager association on `transactions#index` can help avoid the N+1 query problem, improving performance by reducing the number of database queries.
2. Adding an index to the `created_at` column can improve the performance of queries that involve sorting or filtering by creation time. See Others->2.
3. Implementing pagination instead of displaying a large amount of data at once can enhance performance and provide a better user experience.
4. The selection of the manager on `transactions#new` can be deferred until the validation phase to optimize performance and reduce unnecessary database queries.
5. Instead of loading all managers with `Manager.all`, it is more efficient to select a random manager using `Manager.order('RANDOM()').first` to improve performance and memory usage.
6. The addition of the `bundler-leak` gem helps detect memory leaks and ensure the application's memory usage remains stable.

#### Code issues

1. The `transactions#new_large` and `transactions#new_extra_large` actions seem unnecessary and can be removed to simplify the codebase.
2. Complex validation logic in the `Transaction` model can be moved to separate validators to improve code readability, maintainability, and reusability.
3. The `uid` field should have a uniqueness validation to ensure its uniqueness. Additionally, a function to generate a more random value can be implemented instead of using `SecureRandom.hex(5)`.
4. Consolidating the three forms into one or connecting fields using partials can make the code more maintainable and reduce duplication.
5. The generation of `full_name` can be moved to helpers to separate the view logic from the model, following the MVC pattern.
6. Introducing a separate `User` model and having `Manager` and `Client` inherit from it can improve code organization and reduce duplication of name fields.
7. The addition of the `rubocop` gem enforces a consistent code style across the application.

#### Others

1. Lack of tests is a critical issue that affects security, performance, and code quality. Implementing tests is essential to ensure the correctness and reliability of the application.
2. Ask buisness but on my opinion: the order of transactions by `created_at` (descending) can be a logical choice.
3. Ask buisness but on my opinion: updating exchange rates at least once a day and caching them can improve performance and accuracy. The implementation of this feature has been added.
