### Please describe found weak places below.

#### Security issues

1. Lack of form object patterns for input data. When dealing with complex forms or multi-page forms, the absence of form object patterns can lead to validation issues. Implementing form objects can help alleviate these problems and improve validation processes.
2. Insufficient data validation for incoming data. It is essential to incorporate proper data validation measures. Rails standard validation, such as "strong params," can be employed unless there are plans to handle complex forms where form objects would be a more suitable solution.
3. Unencrypted database data. It is crucial to update the application to Rails 7 or employ appropriate encryption techniques for data stored in the database. Failure to do so can lead to data leaks and compromise client information, potentially causing significant harm to the project's reputation. Ensuring that all sensitive data is encrypted is of utmost importance.
4. Lack of user authorization and authentication using the Devise gem. Currently, anyone can create records in the system. To enhance security, it is necessary to implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms, allowing only authorized and authenticated users to read, create, and delete records. Integration of the Devise gem can simplify this process.
5. Insufficient logging of transactions. Systems handling financial transactions should log all transactional changes. The Papertrail gem, or similar tools, can assist in storing transaction-related information, ensuring a reliable audit trail and providing valuable insights for monitoring and debugging.


#### Performance issues

1. Absence of pagination for displaying large record sets. Not implementing pagination for pages displaying a substantial number of records can result in performance issues. Implementing pagination mechanisms would ensure a smoother user experience and alleviate potential performance bottlenecks.
2. Lack of familiarity with techniques for writing performant Ruby code. In order to optimize Ruby code for performance, it is important to be aware of various techniques and best practices. Familiarizing oneself with resources like the Fast Ruby GitHub repository or using RuboCop with a fast Ruby linter can help ensure the codebase is optimized for speed.
3. Usage of default Rails templates in the "render" method of controllers. Default Rails templates can be slow, especially when handling large amounts of data. Consider using faster rendering engines or adopting a frontend approach with a separate Rails API backend (e.g., using Fast JSON API for rendering and React for the frontend). Server-Side Rendering (SSR) might be a suitable option initially but could introduce performance challenges in the long term.
4. Generating UIDs directly in the database for improved speed. Instead of generating UIDs within the application code, it can be more efficient to let the database handle this task. Utilizing database features for generating UIDs can enhance the application's performance.
5. Leveraging a queue with asynchronous jobs for handling transactions. To optimize transaction processing, it is advisable to utilize a queue system with asynchronous jobs. Services like Sidekiq can effectively manage prioritized queues, while also providing error handling, retries, and the ability to revert transactions when necessary.


#### Code issues

1. Lack of linters, specifically RuboCop. Linters are crucial tools for maintaining consistent code style throughout a project, which significantly aids scalability and long-term code maintenance. Integrating RuboCop as part of the development workflow can help identify and rectify code style issues.
2. Absence of tests. Writing tests is fundamental in modern development practices. The Ruby community particularly emphasizes test-driven development, with RSpec being the most popular testing library. Without tests, it becomes challenging to refactor and maintain the application over time, and the understanding of the code's original intent can be lost.
3. Non-utilization of service objects for business logic. Incorporating service objects is a recommended pattern for encapsulating complex business logic. While libraries like Trailblazer offer a ready-made implementation of this pattern, it is also possible to create custom service objects. Using this pattern can prevent models from becoming bloated and unmanageable, often leading to a lack of scalability and maintainability.
4. Handling different currencies with an ENUM and storing them in the database. When dealing with multiple currencies, it is advisable to use an ENUM data type for representing the various currency options. Storing these currencies in the database allows for consistent handling and avoids potential data inconsistencies.
5. Implementing a finite-state machine pattern for transactions. To ensure correct business logic and proper handling of state changes in transactions, it is beneficial to utilize a finite-state machine pattern. This approach enforces the appropriate sequencing of actions and ensures that the application behaves consistently and predictably.
6. To handle money in Rails more effectively, it is recommended to use a decimal data type instead of a simple integer. The decimal data type provides better precision and allows for storing and performing calculations with monetary values accurately.


#### Others

1. Transitioning from Vagrant to Docker and docker-compose for building the initial setup. Vagrant is considered an outdated technology, and modern practices favor the use of Docker and docker-compose for containerization and orchestration. Adopting Docker and docker-compose can improve the testing process and facilitate the reusability of the application's infrastructure.
